          <h2>About Azores</h2>
          <p>
            The Azores Islands are a Portuguese archipelago in the North
            Atlantic Ocean, located about 1,500 km (930 mi) from Lisbon and
            about 3,900 km (2,400 mi) from the east coast of North America. The
            Monchique islet on Flores Island, located at 31° 16′ 24″ W is
            regarded as the westernmost point in Europe, even though from a
            geological standpoint the two westernmost Azorean islands (Flores
            and Corvo) actually lie on the North American plate. Nowadays the
            Azores’ main industries are tourism, raising cattle for milk and
            meat, and fishing.

          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            The Azores islands were discovered or recognized, depending on the
            Historian, in 1427 by Portuguese navigators. The Azores islands were
            populated in the 15th century by pioneers from Portugal although
            small groups of Flemings settled in some of the islands. During the
            16th and 17th centuries the Azores archipelago was one of the
            centers of trade between Europe America and India, and its ports
            sheltered and serviced galleons loaded with treasures.
            <br />
            <br />
            Officially, the first islands were discovered in the fifteenth
            century by Diogo de Silves a Captain at the service of Infante D.
            Henrique. Important naval battles were fought in the waters of the
            Azores in that period, during the attacks by corsairs and pirates.
            The following centuries were calmer, but in 1829 the Azores returned
            to the pages of history with the role played by Terceira in the
            struggle against the absolutist forces, and as the base for the
            liberal forces invading the mainland Portugal to regain power.
